  "summary": "- But like I it's it also it hasn't truly been daily because that laptop has had so many hardware issues that it's been bouncing back and forth between getting serviced and coming back to me that sometimes I end up back on Windows for a while and then I go back to running &gt;&gt; uh various versions of of Linux.\n- In newer builds, Windows will now try to prevent the PC from waking up.\n- I'd say that that's fair game, but I don't think some of the other folks in our cohort would really qualify as a Linux noob and then where do we draw the line?\n- I was reviewing my photos from New York and it's it's it's where I parked my car at the airport and that's like it.\n- So you can absolutely make mistakes but in this case I'm talking about partnering with again an abhorrent organization that it has complete and utter disregard for user security and privacy in some in in some cases like Rage Shadow Legends never led to anyone being you know falsely harassed by law enforcement or you know Raid Shadow Legends never got anyone they never had anyone one have a gun pointed at them because of it.\n- Yeah, it's like a special New Zealand lamb grown by sort of a small farm with very particular rules and regulations and it's not sold retail."
